# Join Queue Menu Animation Fix

## Problem Identified

The expanding "Join Queue" menu had a visual issue where the **bottom white border line would stick around too long** during the animation. The border would only disappear after the animation completed, instead of immediately when expansion started.

## Root Cause

The container div had a fixed `border-2 border-white rounded-lg` that created a complete border around the entire component. During expansion, this border remained static while the content was animating.

**Before Fix:**
```tsx
<div className="
  border-2 border-white rounded-lg 
  overflow-hidden 
  transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out
  w-full
">
```

## Solution Applied

**Conditional Border Styling**: Made the border responsive to the open/closed state so it changes immediately when the menu starts expanding.

**After Fix:**
```tsx
{/* Container */}
<div className={`
  border-2 border-white overflow-hidden 
  transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out
  w-full
  ${isOpen 
    ? 'rounded-t-lg border-b-0'  // Open: top border only
    : 'rounded-lg'               // Closed: full border
  }
`}>

{/* Expanding Panel */}
<div className={`
  overflow-hidden 
  transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out 
  bg-primary w-full
  ${isOpen ? 'border-l-2 border-r-2 border-b-2 border-white rounded-b-lg' : ''}
`}>
```

## How It Works

### **Closed State** (Button only):
- Container: `border-2 border-white rounded-lg` (full border)
- Panel: No border (collapsed)

### **Open State** (Expanded menu):
- Container: `border-2 border-white rounded-t-lg border-b-0` (top/left/right borders only)
- Panel: `border-l-2 border-r-2 border-b-2 border-white rounded-b-lg` (left/right/bottom borders)

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate response**: Bottom border disappears the instant expansion starts  
✅ **Smooth transition**: No visual artifacts during animation  
✅ **Proper appearance**: Complete border around expanded menu when open  
✅ **Clean animation**: No lingering border elements  

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Production build successful  
- ✅ Border disappears immediately on expansion
- ✅ Complete border maintained when fully expanded
- ✅ Clean appearance when collapsed

The expanding menu now has a polished, professional animation with no visual artifacts.
